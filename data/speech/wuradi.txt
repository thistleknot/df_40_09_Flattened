who mistook me for one of [PRO_POS] mindless beasts
who thought [PRO_SUB] could tame me like a lap dog
who considered [PRO_POS]self a wolf yet was ripped apart like a sheep
whose corpse now feeds the beasts [PRO_SUB] was so fond of
whose animal friends could not save [PRO_POS] from her death at my hands
