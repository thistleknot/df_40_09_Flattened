Use PhoebusTilesetAssembler.exe to customize your tileset.

==================================================
To gain some FPS you can try switching [PRINT_MODE:2D] to [PRINT_MODE:STANDARD] in "/data/init/init.txt".
Warning, the STANDARD print_mode can cause crashes on some computers.

==================================================
To use a tileset with punctuation, it could help to edit data/init/d_init.txt and change '[VARIED_GROUND_TILES:YES]' to '[VARIED_GROUND_TILES:NO]'. This will make the game only use the period "." tile for ground tiles.

==================================================
The Phoebus Graphic Pack contains several alternate tilesets:

Default:
Phoebus_16x16.png   (Standard)

Phoebus_16x16_Diagonal.png   (Classic Diagonal Walls)
Phoebus_16x16_Smooth.png   (Ground/Soil with a dithered pattern)

Phoebus_16x16_TextBackground.png   (The same ground/soil background behind all characters)
Phoebus_16x16_TextClean.png   (All characters are letters with black background)


To change which tileset the game uses, you will need to:

1. Open the data/init/init.txt file.

2. Renamed the four lines with "Phoebus_16x16.png" to the name of the alternate tileset of your choice.

3. Strike The Earth!
